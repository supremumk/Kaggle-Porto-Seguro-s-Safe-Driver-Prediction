# Kaggle-Porto-Seguro-s-Safe-Driver-Prediction

Porto Seguro is one of Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance companies. Inaccuracies in car insurance company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones.A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.

The data scource and description can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction).

The **goal** of this competition is to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.


Led a team of four to process the policy holder data with feature engineering including removing low importance features, creating aggregated features, and adding one-hot to categorical features using Python
 Predicted the probability that a driver will file an insurance claim next year using StackNet with 2-layer and 3-layer models combining XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic, Random Forests, and Neural Nets algorithms
 Applied k-fold Cross Validation to tune parameters and aggregated the top performance stacked models
